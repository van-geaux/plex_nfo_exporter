# Plex NFO Exporter

**Plex NFO Exporter** is a script that extracts metadata, posters, and background art from Plex and generates compatible files for use with other media servers like Jellyfin.  

---

## Features
- Extract media metadata from Plex into `.nfo` files.
- Multiple naming formats to export to i.e. poster as `poster.jpg` or `{filename}_poster.jpg`.
- Save files in the media directory for easy use with other media servers.
- **Does not refresh Plex library metadata** during the export process.
- Flexible options:
  - Choose what metadata to export (e.g., title, tagline, plot, year, etc.).
  - Select specific libraries to process.
  - Export all metadata from Plex if needed.
- Support for path mapping between separate Plex and library servers.
- Compatible with **movies**, **TV shows**, and **music** libraries.
- Supports Plex's latest movie and TV agents, as well as [Hama agent](https://github.com/ZeroQI/Hama.bundle).
- Supports multiple movie titles in one directory.

## How to Use

### Using Docker (Recommended)

Run the Plex NFO Exporter using the official Docker image:
```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v /path/to/config:/app \
  -v /path/to/media:/media \
  -e CRON_SCHEDULE="0 4 * * *" \
  -e RUN_IMMEDIATELY=false \
  ghcr.io/van-geaux/plex_nfo_exporter:latest
```

After first deployment, stop the container and fill the generated `config.yml` before running it again.

#### Docker Compose Example

```yaml
services:
  plex-nfo-exporter:
    image: ghcr.io/van-geaux/plex_nfo_exporter:latest
    environment:
      - CRON_SCHEDULE="0 4 * * *" # if not set will default to 4AM everyday
      - RUN_IMMEDIATELY=false  # if true will run immediately the first time regardless of cron
    volumes:
      - /volume2/scripts/plex_nfo_exporter:/app # the config folder, where you put the config.yml
      - /volume1/data/media:/data_media # left side local path, right side plex path. YOU NEED TO SET THIS EVEN IF BOTH ARE THE SAME
```

After first deployment, stop the container and fill the generated `config.yml` before running it again.

#### Building the Image Yourself

To build and run the image from the source code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/van-geaux/plex_nfo_exporter.git
   ```
   ```bash
   cd plex_nfo_exporter
   ```

2. Build the Docker Image
   ```bash
   docker build -t plex_nfo_exporter:latest .
   ```

3. Run the Custom Image
   ```bash
   docker run --rm \
      -v /path/to/config:/app \
      -v /path/to/media:/media \
      -e CRON_SCHEDULE="0 4 * * *" \
      -e RUN_IMMEDIATELY=false \
      ghcr.io/van-geaux/plex_nfo_exporter:latest
   ```

### Running Manually

1. **Download and Prepare the Script**  
   Clone or download the repository, ensuring the following files are included:
   - `config.yml` (will create if not exists)
   - `.env` (will create if not exists)
   - `main.py`  
   - `requirements.txt`  

2. **Configure the Script**  
   Edit `config.yml` and `.env` to include your desired settings and credentials.

3. **Install Python**  
   Install Python (tested with Python 3.9â€“3.11).  

4. **Set Up the Environment**  
   Open a terminal and navigate to the script directory:
   ```bash
   cd /your_directory/plex_nfo_exporter
   ```

   (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env  
   env\Scripts\activate    # Windows  
   source env/bin/activate # macOS/Linux
   ```

5. **Install Dependencies**
   Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Run the Script**
   Execute the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   
## Features and Limitations

1. **Supported Plex Agents**
   - Compatible with Plex's new TV and movie agents.
   - Detects Hama agent and other agents to set metadata source IDs accordingly.

2. **Metadata Export Options**
   - Choose specific metadata fields to export.
   - Defaults include title, tagline, plot, year, and metadata agent IDs.

3. **File Organization**
   - Saves .nfo files as movie.nfo, tvshow.nfo, artist.nfo, album.nfo or other naming schemes as needed.
   - Exports active poster and fanart images as poster.jpg and fanart.jpg.

4. **Sync Across Servers**
   - Ensures that Plex and Jellyfin display the same library metadata, images, and media names.

5. **Docker Image**
   - Docker image available at `ghcr.io/van-geaux/plex_nfo_exporter:latest`.

## Background

- **About Me:**  
   I'm not a developer by trade, but I manage Plex and Jellyfin to enjoy both convenience and flexibility.  
   My primary library is anime in Plex using the Hama agent with romaji names.

- **Why This Script?**  
   I needed a tool to sync Plex and Jellyfin libraries, especially for anime with custom posters and art.  
   Existing tools either require a full library refresh (e.g., Lambda) or work in reverse (e.g., XBMC Importer).

- **Kometa Integration:**  
   I use Kometa to beautify posters, which works perfectly with this script.

## Future Plans

- Enhance compatibility with more media servers.
